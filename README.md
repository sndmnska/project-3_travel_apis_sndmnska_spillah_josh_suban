## Travel Apis 

### By Dan S, Spillah M, Josh M, and Suban A


User inputs city (Ex: "London", "New York", or "Minneapolis") and this program will show various travel related information to user.

1. Travel Advisory for the country the city is located within.
2. Restaurants in that city.
3. Things to do in that city.

Finally it will save this information to show to the user at a later date, effectively bookmarking results of a specific query.
